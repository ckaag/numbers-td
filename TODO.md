- There are three types of towers:
  - One Towers 
    - a bullet from these destroys a one enemy in one shot 
    - other enemies take one damage from such a shot
    - the AI prioritizes close targets with a value of 1
  - Prime Towers
    - a tower can be upgraded from existing one towers
    - it now shoots prime factors, but only at enemies that have them
    - it removes that factor from the enemies value, e.g. a 4 enemy needs to be shot twice by a 2 prime tower, and finally killed by one further 1 tower to be destroyed
  - Effects towers
    - Do not deal damage, but do cause special effects
    - slow tower (decreases speed to enemy)
    - gold tower (increases the gold score of hit enemies)
    - traitor tower (will shoot prime enemies and add 1)
    - return tower (shoots rarely, but causes enemy to move back a little bit)
- building or upgrading a tower opens a menu
  - building one tower only takes confirmation
  - upgrading or scraping a tower has a selection available
  - gray out options that are currently too expensive
- pause button to pause the game
- game can be saved to localstorage
- game can be auto-load from save game to enable fast iteration
- towers should not be placed within the path or each other or the castle
- the path should be drawn from a global seed
- global seed stored in URL fragment for reuse
